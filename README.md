# 🔗 MediBridge Collaboration & Feedback Hub

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents the **bridge‑builder process**:  
how input from clinicians, application specialists, and developers is collected, prioritised, and translated into actionable improvements for MediBridge.  
It ensures **transparency, expectation management, and trust** across all roles.

---

## 🧩 Workflow

### 1. Collecting Input
- **Clinicians**  
  - Daily frustrations (e.g. “too many clicks”, “unclear AI overlay”).  
  - Requests for new features or workflow simplification.  
  - Gathered via workshops, surveys, or support tickets.  

- **Application Specialists**  
  - Observations from training sessions.  
  - Common questions or misunderstandings.  
  - Feedback on system configuration and usability.  

- **Developers**  
  - Known technical limitations.  
  - Suggestions for optimisation.  
  - Insights from logs, error reports, and performance testing.  

---

### 2. Analysis & Prioritisation
- All input is logged in a **Feedback Backlog**.  
- Categorised into:  
  - ✅ **Must Have** – critical for patient safety or workflow.  
  - 💡 **Nice to Have** – improves usability but not critical.  
  - ❌ **Not Feasible** – cannot be implemented due to technical or regulatory constraints.  

---

### 3. Translation for Developers
- Clinician requests are rewritten as **user stories**:  
  - *“As a clinician, I want to save a case with one click, so I can focus on the patient instead of the system.”*  
- Each story includes:  
  - Clinical context (why it matters).  
  - Expected outcome.  
  - Priority level.  

---

### 4. Feedback to Clinicians
- If a request **cannot be implemented**, clinicians receive a **simplified explanation**:  
  - *“We cannot combine ‘save’ and ‘upload’ into one button, because the system must validate data first. Instead, we will make validation run in the background, so it feels faster.”*  
- Always provide an **alternative or compromise**.  

---

### 5. Communication & Transparency
- **Feedback Log** – tracks all requests and their status:  
  - ✅ Implemented  
  - 🛠️ In Progress  
  - ❌ Not Feasible (with explanation + alternative)  

- **Regular Updates** – clinicians and specialists are informed about progress.  
- **Case Studies** – highlight successful changes driven by user feedback.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/feedback-log/` → Markdown files with collected requests and status.  
- `/user-stories/` → Translated clinician requests in developer‑friendly format.  
- `/explanations/` → Simplified explanations for clinicians when requests are not feasible.  
- `README.md` → Overview of the collaboration process (this file).  

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- **Clinicians** feel heard and respected, even when requests can’t be met 1:1.  
- **Developers** get clear, prioritised requirements with clinical context.  
- **Application Specialists** act as amplifiers of feedback and validators of solutions.  
- **The Bridge‑Builder** ensures alignment, transparency, and trust across all roles.
